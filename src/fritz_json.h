// JSON for this adapter: nlohmann, plus the handful of accessors QJsonObject
// used to provide. The same choice phi-core made when it left Qt (core/jsonx.h),
// so a value read here reads the way it reads there.
//
// Two differences from Qt JSON that matter at call sites:
//  - A default-constructed Json is null, not an empty object. Json::object()
//    is what "{}" means.
//  - There is no "undefined". A missing key reads as null; code that needs to
//    tell "absent" from "null" asks contains() first.
